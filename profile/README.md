# The GoNUX Project

*Let's have a Go at Linux.*

## About
The GoNUX project aims to implement all the user-space software necessary for a functional and useable system, entirely in Go. The ultimate goal is to be able to run only GoNUX software on top of a bare linux kernel and make a working linux distro out of it. 

By doing this, the GoNUX project ends up providing alternatives to many of the packages and system utils being used to build all mainstream linux distros.

## Philosophy

The philosophy of GoNUX is NOT to be perfectly stable or minimal or optimised. It is however to reimagine many existing tools and concepts in new and distinct ways.

As such, expect chaotic concepts and implementations, as the GoNUX project is, in its very nature, incredibly experimental.
